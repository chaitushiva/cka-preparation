Traffic management

Downstream: A downstream host connects to Envoy, sends requests, and receives responses.

Upstream: An upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses.

Listener: A listener is a named network location (e.g., port, unix domain socket, etc.) that can be connected to by downstream clients. Envoy exposes one or more listeners that downstream hosts connect to.
